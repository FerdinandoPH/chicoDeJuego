## _A Game Boy emulator written in C By Fernando PÃ©rez HolguÃ­n_

This is a successor to my previous attempt at creating a Game Boy emulator. This time, I will be uing C instead of python, which should make my program run at least as fast as an actual Game Boy, and not 100 times slower ðŸ˜….

As guidance, I will be using the Pan Docs  (https://gbdev.io/pandocs/), Low Level Devel's tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e87qKixKFME&list=PLVxiWMqQvhg_yk4qy2cSC3457wZJga_e5) and what I learned in my CSO class at UAH.
